# Advanced MVC

Until now, the main focus was on the basic patterns of MVC. In this chapter,
we will observe the broader picture of a MVC application and how the patterns interact
with the real world.

* [Model persistence](model_persistence.md)
* [MVC Testing](mvc_testing.md)
* [Notification Granularity](notification_granularity.md)
* [Event Driven programming](event_driven_programming.md)
* [Thrashing prevention](trashing_prevention.md)
* [Validation](validation.md)
* [Lapsed listener problem](lapsed_listener_problem.md)
* [Publisher Subscriber](publisher_subscriber.md)
* [Model Distribution](model_distribution.md)
* [Multithreading](multithreading.md)
* [Notification looping prevention](28_notification_looping_prevention.md): Prevent recursive notification events to propagate.
* [Delayed Model](40_delayed_model.md): Neutralizes fast notifications through a timeout.
* [Throttling](41_throttling.md): Neutralizes fast notifications, but issue a change immediately.
