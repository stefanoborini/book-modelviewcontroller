Javascript MVC
--------------

The client-server nature of web programming gives raise to the need for MVC on
both sides. While we examined MVC on the server side until now, we now examine
client side. This is normally done through javascript.


Views
-----

JavaScript views are normally concerned with manipulating

- the DOM, or
- a canvas object


FIXME
Maria implements true MVC. All other frameworks implement a derivation of MV*, where in particular
the controller takes a different approach. Backbone uses Routers.
Study javascript mvc in more details.
