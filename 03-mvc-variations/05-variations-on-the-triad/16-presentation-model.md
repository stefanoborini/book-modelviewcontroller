# Presentation Model

A model, non visual representation of the view. It incorporates logic and state of the
View. The View observes the Presentation Model and updates accordingly when events are
reported. The model is unaware of the view.

Very similar in idea to Application Model. In practice, it is the same, just formalized.

FIXME: Integrate somewhere else?
