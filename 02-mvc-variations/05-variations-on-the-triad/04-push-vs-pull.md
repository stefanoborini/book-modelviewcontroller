# 2.5.4 Push vs. pull

Defining “push-vs-pull” within the realm of MVC can lead to confusion, because it is an overloaded term. We will talk here about the 
We will discuss of the “Push-pull” model for MVC also in the context of web frameworks.

This is known as the “pull” model. The view is informed of its outdated state, and pulls information from the model. The alternative is the “push” model, where the model notifies the view and passes its new state to the view.

Push model: the view register with the model and receives notification of changes.
Pull model: the view fetches the new state from the model.

Note: unclear. Also possible mixup between overloaded meaning in GUI MVC and Web MVC.
