# 2.3.5 Mediating controller

### Motivation

Connects one specific widget with one specific property.
Very reusable.
Non-declarative form of data binding.
Can do validation.

FIXME: We should already have it somewhere in the notes or the coarse vs. fine view.

### Practical Examples

NSController and Cocoa bindings.
