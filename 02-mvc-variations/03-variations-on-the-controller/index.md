# 2.3 Variations on the Controller

Generally, the change is applied to the Model, but depending on the problem the
Controller can also directly modify the View, in particular when it changes
visual state that is purely pertinent to the View and is not represented in the
Model. Examples of these cases can be enabling/disabling some widget,
scaling/zooming of a plot area, reordering of menu entries and so on.
