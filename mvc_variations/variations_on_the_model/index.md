# Variations on the Model

   * [Compositing Model](compositing_model.md): Aggregate data from multiple Models, providing a single point of access to the View.
   * [Model Pipe](model_pipe.md): Intercept, modify, and filter data flow between Model and View.
   * [Application Model](03_application_model.md): Holds visual state to complement business logic state.
   * [Side-by-Side application model](04_side_by_side_application_model.md): Holds complementary information to the current model.
   * [UI Retrieving Model](ui_retrieving_model.md): Model retrieves information from the User through UI elements.
   * [ModelController](model_controller.md): Aggregates Model and Controller logic in a single object.
   * [Local Model](local_model.md): Preserve the original Model state so that changes can be reverted.
   * [Value Model](value_model.md): Trivialize complex Model interface to a simple, universal interface.
   * [Proxy Model](proxy_model.md): Acts as proxy, hiding complexity to access resources from a backend.
   * [Collection Model](collection_model.md): Holds and aggregates Model objects of the same type.
   * [View-aware Model](view_aware_model.md): A model that knows its views interface beyond simple notification delivery.
   * [Caching Model](caching_model.md): Holds data in local cache to mitigate slow access.
   * [Data/Metadata Model](data_metadata_model.md): Separate access to slow and bulky data vs. fast, lean and descriptive.
   * [Recording Model](recording_model.md): Record the changes for later consumption.
   * [Transactional Setting](transactional_setting.md): Setting multiple attributes at once with late notification.
