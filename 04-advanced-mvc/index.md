# 4 Advanced MVC

Until now, the main focus was on the basic patterns of MVC. In this chapter,
we will observe the broader picture of a MVC application and how the patterns interact
with the real world. We will analyse the following:

- Additional layers often found in UI applications: Service and IO.
- Advanced patterns required for Models and Notification strategies
- Common problems encountered during MVC development.
- Interactions with multithreaded programming, asynchronous programming and the event loop
- Techniques for debugging and testing of MVC applications
