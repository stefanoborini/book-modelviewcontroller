# Variations on the Controller

* [Supervising controller](39_supervising_controller.md)
* [Event Filter](event_filter.md): Examine and potentially handle UI events before they reach the View.
* [Mediating Controller](mediating_controller.md): Connects widget and properties.
* [Coordinating controller](coordinating_controller.md): Controllers managing the lifetime of the application, rather than a specific View.
* [Action](action.md): Controller with visual representation encapsulating a command.
* [Action Filter](action_filter.md): Perform behavior before or after the execution of a Controller action.
